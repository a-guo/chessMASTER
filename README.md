Note: this program runs on Windows!

Originally this project was programmed in XCode on Mac, and with the plan to implement a chess engine. However, after encountering SFML constaints that would make coding a chess engine unlikely to success, it was reprogrammed in the Windows environment, using Stockfish as a chess engine, in order to still use SFML. Check out my other projects for work on chess engines.
